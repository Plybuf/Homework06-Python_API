# Homework06-Python_API
GitHub location for Homework assignment 6 - Python APIs.

This repository contains the code, images, and data files associated with Homework assignment #6 - working with Python APIs.

Note that the starter code is still in the folder but does not contain any updates. The official submission is the "WeatherPy-MLW.ipynb" file.

I have added a set of bonus analyses today, October 6th.  The submission for this is: "WeatherPy-MLW-Bonus.ipynb" in the code folder.
I have also added graphs and their output showing the geographic locations of the cities.  You can see more patterns in this way.
